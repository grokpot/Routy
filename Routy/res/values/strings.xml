        plan on visiting in any order. If you don\'t know the exact address, just type in the name of the place
        or intersection and we\'ll see what we can find for you that\'s located near your origin. You can also

        you\'re ready, click Route it! to see the results! To reset your origin just press the android back
        button to go back to the previous screen.</string>
