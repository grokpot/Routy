1.1.2
[NEW]
* ADDED Now tapping "Done" or "Next" after entering all your destinations will calculate your route.  Just making the workflow better.

[FIXES]
* FIXED A bug that sometimes caused Routy to crash when "Route It" was tapped.
* FIXED Map is now dependent on screen size, so it should scale for larger screens.

================
